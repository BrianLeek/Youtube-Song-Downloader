# Youtube Song Downloader 
Youtube Song Downloader by [Palash Sureka](https://github.com/fast-and-curious-1910) and modified by [Brian Leek](https://github.com/BrianLeek).

## About 
This is a song downloader made in Python. Have you ever wanted to download a song for your phone, class, zumba / yoga or anything else? Guess what, this script has you covered!

The modifications I made to this script is making it run with just one file and ask the user for the song name and creates the "songs.txt" file for you and deletes it after the script finishes. All the user needs to do is run the script and enter the song name and the script handles the rest. It's better then editing the songs file and running two different Python files.

## Usage

*Important Note : Chromewebdriver path must be set in main.py where is says "driverpath".

Run main.py then the script will ask you for the song you would like to download and then the magic will happen. Then a few things will happen:

1. A new tab will open in Chrome.
2. It will go to YouTube.com and copy the link of the first result.
3. Then it will got to YTMP3.cc, paste the link and download the file.

That's it! It isn't the fastest method or the best but it works.
